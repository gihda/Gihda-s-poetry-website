            <h2>My First Poem</h2>
            <p>
                Where did the road lead me?<br><br>

                Where did the road lead me,<br>
                Or should I say, where did I lead myself?<br>
                All I wanted was to live a fairytale and smile all the way through.<br>
                Others wondered how I stayed so happy,<br>
                Others wondered if I ever shed tears.<br>
                Well, I am no better than a human with floss,<br>
                No better than a mere mortal with fairytale dreams.<br><br>

                But still, I wander with hope in my heart,<br>
                Chasing a future, where the road won’t fall apart.<br>
                Though the path is uncertain, and the end far away,<br>
                I’ll keep walking, day by day.<br><br>

                For the road will lead me where I need to go,<br>
                And in my heart, I’ll always know.<br>
                The fairytale may be fleeting,<br>
                But the joy of the journey is worth repeating.
