    <h2>My First Poem</h2>
    <p>
        Where did the road lead me?<br><br>

Where did the road lead me,<br>
Or should I say, where did I lead myself?<br>
All I wanted was to live a fairytale and smile all the way through.<br>
Others wondered how I stayed so happy,<br>
Others wondered if I ever shed tears.<br>
Well, I am no better than a human with floss,<br>
No better than a mere mortal with fairytale dreams.<br><br>

But still, I wander with hope in my heart,<br>
Chasing a future, where the road won’t fall apart.<br>
Though the path is uncertain, and the end far away,<br>
I’ll keep walking, day by day.<br><br>

For the road will lead me where I need to go,</p>
And in my heart, I’ll always know.<br>
The fairytale may be fleeting,<br>
But the joy of the journey is worth repeating.<br>
